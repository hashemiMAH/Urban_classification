# Urban_classification
 Python scripts have been developed to calculate the water use of landscaping in urban areas.   In order to accomplish this, two Python scripts have been developed using Jupyter in HydroShare. One of them uses Lands 8 images to classify the area of interest into three categories: Street, Building, and Landscaping, which can be applied to the entire urban region around the world. 
 In this case, the python script has been developed for Logan City i, UT, USA .The shape file for the city can be downloaded here. Place it in the same directory as the Puthon script.  

  Another Python script has been developed to use NAIP Imageried for USA with spatial resolution 1 meter by 1 meter.

 To calculate water use, we developed a Python script in Colab, which can be found on Hydrosahre.
